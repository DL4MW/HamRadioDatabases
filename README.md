Locator and Callsign Databases for European VHF Contesting

In Ham Radio Contests it's the goal to make as much connections as possible. On VHF frequencies (100MHz and above, up to several GHz) usually a control number and the locator as Maidenhead format is interchanged.

This repository holds some databases which can be used in the Contest log software Win-Test and N1MM-logger. The databases are based on the German contest logs which are published by the DARC.

The software to create the databases is contained in https://github.com/DL4MW/locatorDB
